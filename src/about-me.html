                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>My first job was a part-time English teacher position in an extracurricular institution. I taught EFL primary students in China in my senior year. After coming to Australia and getting a teacher degree, I worked as an Early Childhood Teacher. I have experience working with children with high needs and families from diverse backgrounds, which greatly strengthened my interpersonal skills. </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I did my bachelor’s degree on Business English (targeting international finance). Upon graduation I realised I had little interests in working in a bank or accounting organisation, and my experience as an English teacher inspired me to give education and training a try. Half a year later, I came to Australia and studied for a master’s degree on teaching (early childhood and primary) in Melbourne. </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I am a big fan of opera. When I was in highschool, I saw a little girl singing an opera aria in America's Got Talent and got obssessed with this genre of music. I once skipped half of my graduation ceremony to go to one of my favourite opera <em>the Barber of Seville</em>.
