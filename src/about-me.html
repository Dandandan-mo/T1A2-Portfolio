                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>My first job was a part-time English teacher position in an extracurricular institution during my senior year. I taught EFL primary students in China. After coming to Australia and getting a teacher degree here, I became an Early Childhood Teacher and I taught in long day care centres in Regional Victoria, Canberra, and Melbourne for two year and a half. I am experienced in working with children with high needs and families from diverse backgrounds, and I had successfully supported the inclusion and engagement of many traumatised and special needs children into the daily routines and educational programs through proactive communication with families and specialists and the design and implementation of individual support plan based on my understanding of children's needs. </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I did my bachelor’s degree in Business English (targeting international finance). Upon graduation my intern experience as an English teacher inspired me to give education and training a try. In 2018, I came to Australia and studied for a master’s degree in teaching (early childhood and primary). In 2022, I decided to have a career change and started learning coding. I enrolled in a web development course and got a diploma of IT in February 2023. </p>

                <h2>Interest</h2>
                <p>I am a big fan of opera and classical music. I volunteered as a bilingual tour guide in Guangzhou Opera House for 2 years in my bachelor years just to get the latest information on the perfomances and rehearsals in the opera house.</p>
