                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I worked as an Early Childhood Teacher for 2.5 years in Regional Victoria, Canberra, and Melbourne. As a teacher I have worked with many children and families with special needs, and in order to support them, I had constant communication with the external and internal stakeholders including my co-workers, educational leaders, centre director, families, therapiests and specialists, and officers from NDIS. Based on the feedback from the stakeholders and my observation on children's interests and needs, I worked with my team to design and implement individual support plans for children with additional needs, and successfully included and engaged those children in the daily routines and learning. The teaching experience have greatly strengthened my interpersonal skills.

                <p>Prior to comming to Australia, I was a part-time English teacher position in an extracurricular institution during my senior year. I taught EFL primary students in China. </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I did my bachelor’s degree in Business English (targeting international finance). Upon graduation I came to Australia and studied for a master’s degree in teaching (early childhood and primary) inspired by my teaching expereience in China. In 2022, the experience of exploring, experimenting, and problem-solving in the inquiry-based STEM projects with the children reignited my passion for science and technology. I decided to have a career change and started learning coding. I enrolled with Coder Academy and completed the course with a diploma of IT in February 2023. </p>
