                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I worked as a part-time English teacher in an extracurricular institution during my senior year. I taught EFL primary students in my home country China. After coming to Australia and getting a teacher degree here, I became an Early Childhood Teacher.I had experience working with children with high needs and families from diverse backgrounds. I worked in long day care centres in Regional Victoria, Canberra, and Melbourne for two year and a half. </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I did my bachelor’s degree on Business English (targeting international finance). Upon graduation I realised I had little interests in working in a bank or accounting organisation, and my experience as an English teacher inspired me to give education and training a try. In 2018, I came to Australia and studied for a master’s degree of teaching (early childhood and primary) in Melbourne. </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I am a big fan of opera. 11 years ago I saw a little girl singing an opera aria in a talent show and have been obssessed with this genre of music since then. I skipped half of my graduation ceremony to go to one of my favourite opera 'the Barber of Seville'.</p>
